flightctl collection Release Notes
==================================

.. contents:: Topics

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Added support for Flight Control API v0.10.0 and improved the FlightCtl inventory plugin robustness.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Updated the Ansible collection to support Flight Control API version 0.10.0.
- Added support for Basic auth (username/password) in the inventory plugin for environments with proxies that accept HTTP Basic.
- Improved documentation and examples for `flightctl_config_file` (FlightCtl config) and config precedence.
- Added `hostnames` option for selecting the device field (dot path) as the inventory hostname.
- Inventory plugin now supports `group_by` option for grouping devices by a field value.

Bugfixes
--------

- Inventory plugin now sends Authorization headers explicitly for list operations, resolving authentication failures when the client library does not auto-attach tokens.
- Remove noisy warning when no configuration file is provided; plugin proceeds quietly without a config file.
- Treat `host` as a string (not a path) to prevent URLs from being coerced into file paths, fixing "No host specified" errors.
