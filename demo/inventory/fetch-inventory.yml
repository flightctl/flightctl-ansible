# With the setup as follows:

#  plugin: flightctl.core.flightctl
#  flightctl_validate_certs: False
#  verify_ssl: False

#        - fleet = 'fleet-00'
#      field_selectors:
#        - metadata.name = 'device-03'

#    - name: group6

#        - metadata.owner = "Fleet/fleet-06"
#  request_timeout: 120
#  flightctl_config_file: <path>/.config/flightctl/client.yaml
#
#  Note: The above example of `flightctl.inventory.yaml` it uses `flightctl_config_file` to read values from it.
#         Those values may be overridden in the `flightctl.inventory.yaml` file itself.
