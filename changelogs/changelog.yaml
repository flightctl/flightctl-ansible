  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Inventory plugin now sends Authorization headers explicitly for list operations,
        resolving authentication failures when the client library does not auto-attach
        tokens.
      - Remove noisy warning when no configuration file is provided; plugin proceeds
        quietly without a config file.
      - Treat `host` as a string (not a path) to prevent URLs from being coerced into
        file paths, fixing "No host specified" errors.
      minor_changes:
      - Added support for Basic auth (username/password) in the inventory plugin for
        environments with proxies that accept HTTP Basic.
      - Improved documentation and examples for `flightctl_config_file` (FlightCtl
        config) and config precedence.
